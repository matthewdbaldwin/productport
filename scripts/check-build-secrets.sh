# check-build-secrets.sh — fail the build if a credential can reach a shipped image.
#
# Why this exists. On 2026-09-06 all 9 fleet repos were found shipping a live
# GitHub Packages token (and 7 a Sentry token) inside their published ECR
# images. Three mechanisms, all banned here:
#
#   ENV FOO_TOKEN=...          persists into the FINAL image config, so it is in
#                              `docker inspect` on the pushed image and in the
#                              running container's environment
#   ARG FOO_TOKEN              recorded in `docker history` for the build
#   --build-arg FOO_TOKEN=...  the workflow side of the same leak
#   --build-arg FOO_TOKEN      the no-`=` form, which INHERITS the value from the
#                              build environment and lands in history just the same
#
# The supported way to pass a credential to a build is a BuildKit secret mount:
#   Dockerfile:  RUN --mount=type=secret,id=npm_token,required=true \
#                    NODE_AUTH_TOKEN="$(cat /run/secrets/npm_token)" npm ci
#   workflow:    docker build --secret id=npm_token,env=NODE_AUTH_TOKEN ...
# The value is then never in argv, never in `docker history`, never in the config.
#
# Escape hatch: `build-secrets-guard: allow <reason>` in a comment on the
# offending line or the one directly above it.

# A name containing any of these words is treated as a credential. Matched

# DSN is deliberately absent -- a Sentry DSN is public by design and all 9 web
# images legitimately carry one. NEXT_PUBLIC_* is deliberately NOT exempt: a
# credential inlined into the client bundle is worse, not better.
